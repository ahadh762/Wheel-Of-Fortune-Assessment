## Game Set Up:

* 3 Players
* 3 rounds total
* Each round (Rounds 1 & 2) have separate banks for each player
* First 2 rounds have all 3 players and last round has only 1 player (the player with the highest bank after first 2 rounds)
* Starting player chosen randomly 

<br />

## Gameplay: (First 2 Rounds)


* When the round starts, starting player must spin wheel
* If the wheel selection is BANKRUPT, reset player bank to 0 and end their turn
* If wheel selection is a $ value, player can guess a consonant or guess word
* If player guesses consonant correctly, they get money per letter 
    * E.g., wheel lands on $700, player guesses ‘c’, ‘c’ appears three times, player gets $2100 in their bank
* After player guesses a consonant correctly, they then can do 1 of 3 things:
    1. Spin wheel again
    2. Buy vowel ($250 per vowel) 
        * They can keep buying vowels as long as they are in the word
            * However, if vowel is not in the word, they lose $250 and their turn
            * Obviously, the player must have at least $250 in their round bank to purchase a vowel
            * When a player purchases a vowel, they do not lose $250 per vowel (e.g., if player buys ‘a’ and it appears 3 times, they only lose $250)
    3. Guess the word
        * If guess is successful, round ends and players keep whatever they earned that round
* If player guesses consonant or word incorrectly, they lose their turn
* Round ends when player guesses the word correctly

<br />

## Gameplay: Final Round:

* 1 final round with the person with the highest bank.
* Player spins special wheel with prizes (cash or items like a brand-new car)
* Final round starts with letters R-S-T-L-N-E revealed
* In the final round, the player can pick 3 more consonants and 1 more vowel
* Timer of 10 seconds for the player to guess that answer
* If they guess the final answer correctly, show them the cash prize that they won
* Show the player’s total earnings after game is over

<br />

## Game End:

* Ask to play again (y/n)
* If 'y', reset the game with new players
* If 'n', close the game
