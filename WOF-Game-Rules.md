Game Set Up:
·      3 Players
·      3 rounds total
·      First 2 rounds have all 3 players and last round has only 1 player (the player with the highest bank)
·      Each round (Rounds 1 & 2) have separate banks for each player
·      Starting player chosen randomly
 
 
Gameplay: (First 2 Rounds)
·      Person must spin wheel each round
·      If the wheel selection is BANKRUPT, reset player bank to 0 and end their turn
·      If wheel selection is a $ value, player aan guess a consonant or guess word
·      If player guesses consonant correctly, they get money per letter (e.g., wheel lands on $700, player
       guesses ‘c’, ‘c’ appears three times, player gets $2100 in their bank)

·      At this point player can do 1 of 3 things:
    o   Spin wheel again
    o   Buy vowel ($250 per vowel) 
        §  They can keep buying vowels as long as they are in the word. However, if vowel is not in the
           word, they lose $250 and their turn
        §  Obviously, the player must have at least $250 in their round bank to purchase a vowel
        §  When a player purchases a vowel, they do not lose $250 per vowel (e.g., if player buys ‘a’ and  
           it appears 3 times, they only lose $250)
    o   Guess the word
        §  If guess is successful, round ends and players keep whatever they earned that round
·      If player guesses consonant or word incorrectly, they lose their turn
 
 
Final Round:
·      1 final round with the person with the highest bank.
·      Player spins special wheel with prizes (cash or items like a brand-new car)
·      Final round starts with letters R-S-T-L-N-E revealed
·      In the final round, the player can pick 3 more consonants and 1 more vowel
·      Timer of 10 seconds for the player to guess that answer
·      If they get the final answer, show them the cash prize that they won
·      Show player’s total earnings after game is over
